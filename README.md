## Feature detection network-based correction method for accurate nano-tomography reconstruction


## Abstract

Driven by the development of advanced X-ray optics, such as Fresnel zone plates, nano-resolution full-field transmission X-ray microscopy (Nano-CT) has become a powerful technique for the non-destructive volumetric inspection of objects and has long been developed at different synchrotron radiation facilities. However, the nano-tomography data are often associated with a random sample jitter because of the drift or the radial/axial error motion of the rotate stage during the measurement. Without a proper sample jitter correction process prior to the reconstruction, the use of Nano-CT in providing accurate 3D structure information for the sample is almost impossible. In this paper, to realize the accurate 3D reconstruction for the Nano-CT, an accurate correction method based on feature detection neural network, which can automatically extract the target feature from the projective image and precisely correct the sample jitter errors, is proposed, thereby resulting in a high-quality nanoscale 3D reconstruction. We demonstrated the validity of the proposed method using simulated and experimental datasets. Compared with the traditional correction method, even if the target feature is overlapped by other high-density materials or impurities, the proposed correction method still has the advantages of high precision, lower experimental costs, and fast calculation for the Nano-CT reconstruction.
